## About the project:

There are five main classes:

* Node class -  * This class represents the set of operations applicable on a node (vertex) in a (directional) weighted graph.

* Edge class â€“ This class represents the set of operations applicable on a directional edge(src,dest) in a (directional) weighted graph.

* DGraph - This class represents a directional weighted graph. The class has a road-system or communication network in mind - and should support a large number of nodes.

* Graph_Algo - This class represents the "regular" Graph Theory algorithms (more details in viki).

* Graph_GUI - This class uses the stdDraw class to draw the graphs we built.
